### Application Description:
Dear Doctor is an application made to give people the ability to record intake (food & drink) as well as symptoms. This information will be presented in table form to be shared with the user's healthcare provider in order to find potential correlations between symptoms and intake over time.
***
### The Problem It's Solving:
Dear Doctor will save the hassle of bringing pen and paper wherever you go, by utilizing something that the majority of people carry with them every day, their phones. The flip side of this is applications that exist that add too many complicated features, for people who just need the basics. That's where Dear Doctor comes in.
***
### How to Use Dear Doctor:
Usage of Dear Doctor is simple and intuitive. There is an Add Button, which prompts the user to add an intake type or symptom, there is a Search Button, which displays all of the Diary input to the user, and there is a Sign In/Sign Up button allowing the application to save a user's previous input and allowing the database to store the each user's information separately.
